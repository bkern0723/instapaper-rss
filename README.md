# Instapaper RSS With Additional API

This is a fork of Coedice's [instapaper-rss repo](https://github.com/Coedice/instapaper-rss). 

The intent of this fork is: 
- to add a front-end and API (with Vue and FastAPI) for easier configuration editing.
- to implement easier/seamless deployment for self-hosters via containerization (Docker and hopefully also a Proxmox script)

# Instapaper RSS

Subscribe to RSS/Atom feeds and save items to [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/).

## Quick start

1. Add your [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u) cookies to `config/cookies.yml`
2. Configure the RSS feeds you would like to subscribe to in `config/sources.yml`
3. Run command `make run`

## Sources YAML

In the `config/sources.yml` the following attributes may be used:

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| - | - | - |
| `url` | The URL to the RSS feed, a webpage which has an RSS feed, or an Instagram profile | Required |
| `description` | A description of what the source is | Optional |
| `priority` | Priority name from `config/priorities.yml`. If omitted, `default_priority` from `config/settings.yml` is used | Optional |
| `wrappers` | Ordered list of wrapper names to apply to the entry URL | Optional |
| `blacklist_regex` | A regex pattern to match against the title of the RSS item. If it matches, the item will not be saved | Optional |
| `whitelist_regex` | A regex pattern to match against the title of the RSS item. If it matches, the item will be saved | Optional |
| `allowed_languages` | A list of allowable languages for the RSS item's title to be writen in, in order to be saved | Optional |

## Wrappers

Wrappers let you transform where an item is saved or viewed. Each template takes the original entry URL and nests it into another URL before it is sent to Instapaper.

Wrappers are defined in `config/wrappers.yml` as a mapping of wrapper names to URL templates containing `{url}`. The `{url}` placeholder is replaced with the entry URL and wrappers are applied in the order listed per feed. Two wrappers are included by default:

- `summarise`: Sends the entry URL to Perplexity with a summarisation prompt.
- `archive`: Saves via Archive.today
- `en_translate`: Translates the page via Google Translate to English.

## Settings

The application reads configuration values from `config/settings.yml`. The following keys are supported:

- `testing_mode`: When true the program will not actually save entries to Instapaper; it will only print what it would do. Useful for development and testing.
- `default_priority`: Priority name to use for feeds that do not set `priority` explicitly in `config/sources.yml`.
- `ntfy`: Optional mapping with `host` and `topic` keys. When both are set, error notifications (feed fetch failures, Instagram failures, Instapaper save failures, and unhandled crashes) are sent to the given ntfy topic. Both keys are optional — omit the whole section to disable notifications.

Example:

```yaml
testing_mode: false
default_priority: normal
ntfy:
  host: ntfy.sh
  topic: my-errors
```

Priority rules are defined in `config/priorities.yml`. Each priority is a mapping with:

- `check_every`: Process the feed once every N eligible runs. Runs are staggered by feed URL hash so feeds with the same priority do not all process at once.
- `time_ranges`: Optional list of local-time windows. A feed is only eligible while the current time falls within one of these ranges.
- `days`: Required list inside each `time_ranges` item to define which days the window applies to (`mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`).

Example:

```yaml
high:
	check_every: 1
	time_ranges:
		- days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun]
			start: "00:00"
			end: "23:59"

normal:
	check_every: 3
	time_ranges:
		- days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
			start: "16:30"
			end: "22:59"
		- days: [sat, sun]
			start: "00:00"
			end: "23:59"

low:
	check_every: 3
	time_ranges:
		- days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun]
			start: "18:00"
			end: "22:59"
```

You can add your own priorities by editing `config/priorities.yml` and then referencing the new priority name from `config/sources.yml`.

## Setting up Auto-run

A reccomended way to use this tool:

1. Set up an internet-connected always-on computer (such as a Raspberry Pi)
2. Unstall `uv` on that computer
3. Update `REMOTE_LOGIN_IDENTIFIER` and `REMOTE_PATH` in the `Makefile` to your choice
4. Run command `make deploy`
5. Add crontab `0 * * * * cd /home/pi/Documents/instapaper-rss && PATH="/home/pi/.local/bin:$PATH" make run > /home/pi/log.txt 2>&1`
